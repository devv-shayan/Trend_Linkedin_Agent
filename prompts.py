EXAMPLE:
What makes you sick?

If someone asks me this today, I'll say the idea of being dependent on someone.

- Relying on someone for my basic needs.
- Expecting someone to buy the things I want.
- Or simply having to ask someone to drop me off somewhere.

When I look at myself now, I feel proud of how far I've come.

- Not because I have the perfect job, I don't.
- Not because I've scored the highest marks in my degree, I haven't.
- And not because I've achieved everything I dreamed of, I'm still on the journey.

I feel proud because I'm growing.
I'm working on myself, for myself and for the people around me.

From a little girl who dreamed of earning for herself,
To a woman who now buys what she wants for herself and her loved ones.

Life hasn't gone the way I planned,
For example I wanted to a Dr and now I am studying engineering.

Hilarious right?

But But it has still been nothing short of amazing.

Not because things were spoon-fed to me.

But because I always believed I could achieve what I manifested and worked for.

To the girls waiting for a prince charming,
No one's coming to save you.

And even if someone does, you never know what fate holds.

So start working for yourself before it's too late.

Recently, I started riding a scooty.
And let me tell you, there's nothing more Fascinating than being the one in control,
Instead of being a passenger princess.

P.s: If you see me somewhere, change the lane because it's better to be safe than sorry.

Haha I am kidding.

P.s.s: Do you know the line written on my picture?

It's from a famous novel.

~ Your Storyteller from Kashmir.
